# Notes

- Data manipulation contains tasks done while learning about arrays, sets, and other methods to manipulate data in ES6.

## Arrays

- An array is a data structure that enables storing of a collection of information under one variable.
- Characteristics of arrays in ES6:
    1. Arrays in JavaScript are resizable.
    2. JS arrays are not associative
    3. The arrays are zero-indexed.
    4. Operations done on JS arrays create shallow copies.
