# Notes

- Hoisting is a mechanism where the declaration of variables and functions is moved to the top before the code is executed.

### var
- var is used to declare variables with global scope.
- var variables can be re-declared and updated.

### let 
- let declares variables with block(block refers to a chunk of code enclosed in curly braces) scope.
- let variables can be updated but not re-declared.

### const
- const is used to declare variables that cannot be changed throughout the code.
